This issue has impeded improvements to healthcare software and has delayed the long-predicted prevalence of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Until now, it has been very difficult to share data between healthcare organizations, resulting in poor statistical models due to unrepresentative patient cohorts. Synthetic data, i.e., artificial but realistic electronic health records, could overcome the drought that is troubling the healthcare sector. Deep neural network architectures, in particular, have shown an incredible ability to learn from complex data sets and generate large amounts of unseen data points with the same statistical properties as the training data. Here, we present a generative neural network model that can create synthetic health records with realistic timelines. These clinical trajectories are generated on a per-patient basis and are represented as linear-sequence graphs of clinical events over time. We use a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples from real-world electronic health records. Our approach generates health records not seen in the training data. We show that these artificial patient trajectories are realistic and preserve patient privacy and can therefore support the safe sharing of data across organizations.",,0,1,repositoryam,Green,AIR,ANR-19-CHIA-0020,American Institutes for Research

The disease progresses through heterogeneous genetic alterations, and patients often develop pulmonary metastases even after the primary tumors have been surgically removed. Ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) regulate several critical cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional activation, and signal transduction. Various studies have revealed the significance of USP37 in the regulation of replication stress and oncogenesis. Methods: In this study, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed to investigate USP37 expression. RNA sequencing was utilized to assess the impact of USP37 overexpression and depletion on gene expression in osteosarcoma cells. Various molecular assays, including colony formation, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and DNA replication restart, were employed to examine the physical interaction between USP37 and PCNA, as well as its physiological effects in osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, molecular docking studies were conducted to gain insight into the nature of the interaction between USP37 and PCNA. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed on archived tissue blocks from osteosarcoma patients to establish a correlation between USP37 and PCNA expression. Results: Analysis of the TCGA database revealed that increased expression of USP37 was linked to decreased progression-free survival (PFS) in osteosarcoma patients. Next-generation sequencing analysis of osteosarcoma cells demonstrated that overexpression or knockdown of USP37 led to the expression of different sets of genes. USP37 overexpression provided a survival advantage, while its depletion heightened sensitivity to replication stress in osteosarcoma cells. USP37 was found to physically interact with PCNA, and molecular docking studies indicated that the interaction occurs through unique residues. In response to genotoxic stress, cells that overexpressed USP37 resolved DNA damage foci more quickly than control cells or cells in which USP37 was depleted. The expression of USP37 varied in archived osteosarcoma tissues, with intermediate expression seen in 52% of cases in the cohort examined. Conclusion: The results of this investigation propose that USP37 plays a vital role in promoting replication stress tolerance in osteosarcoma cells. The interaction between USP37 and PCNA is involved in the regulation of replication stress, and disrupting it could potentially trigger synthetic lethality in osteosarcoma. This study has expanded our knowledge of the mechanism through which USP37 regulates replication stress, and its potential as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma merits additional exploration.",Deubiquitinating enzymes | Metastasis | Proliferating cell nuclear antigen | Replication stress | Ubiquitin specific protease 37,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CSU,undefined,Columbus State University

The SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) algorithm has been developed as an effective resampling method for imbalanced data classification by oversampling samples from the minority class. However, samples generated by SMOTE may be ambiguous, low-quality and non-separable with the majority class. To enhance the quality of generated samples, we proposed a novel self-inspected adaptive SMOTE (SASMOTE) model that leverages an adaptive nearest neighborhood selection algorithm to identify the “visible” nearest neighbors, which are used to generate samples likely to fall into the minority class. To further enhance the quality of the generated samples, an uncertainty elimination via self-inspection approach is introduced in the proposed SASMOTE model. Its objective is to filter out the generated samples that are highly uncertain and inseparable with the majority class. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing SMOTE-based algorithms and demonstrated through two real-world case studies in healthcare, including risk gene discovery and fatal congenital heart disease prediction. By generating the higher quality synthetic samples, the proposed algorithm is able to help achieve better prediction performance (in terms of F1 score) on average compared to the other methods, which is promising to enhance the usability of machine learning models on highly imbalanced healthcare data.",Adaptive nearest neighborhood selection | Imbalanced data classification in healthcare | Self-inspection | SMOTE-based resampling,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NIMH,R01MH121394,National Institute of Mental Health

Results: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas HCC data, we identify 12 putative TSGs with negative associations between promoter DNA methylation and transcript abundance, with limited genetic alterations. All HCC samples harbor at least one silenced TSG, suggesting that combining a specific panel of genomic targets could maximize efficacy, and potentially improve outcomes as a personalized treatment strategy for HCC patients. Unlike epigenetic modifying drugs lacking locus selectivity, CRISPRa systems enable potent and precise reactivation of at least 4 TSGs tailored to representative HCC lines. Concerted reactivation of HHIP, MT1M, PZP, and TTC36 in Hep3B cells inhibits multiple facets of HCC pathogenesis, such as cell viability, proliferation, and migration.

Approximately one-third of patients on hemodialysis (HD) have protein malnutrition. Therefore, the serum albumin level of patients on HD is strongly correlated with mortality. Methods: In study, the data sets were obtained from the longitudinal electronic health records of the largest HD center in Taiwan from July 2011 to December 2015, included 1,567 new patients on HD who met the inclusion criteria. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of clinical factors with low serum albumin, and the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) was used for feature selection. The quantile g-computation method was used to calculate the weight ratio of each factor. Machine learning and deep learning (DL) methods were used to predict the low serum albumin.

The AUC and accuracy of the GOA quantile g-computation weight model combined with the Bi-LSTM method were 98% and 95%, respectively. Conclusion: The GOA method was able to rapidly identify the optimal combination of factors associated with serum albumin in patients on HD, and the quantile g-computation with DL methods could determine the most effective GOA quantile g-computation weight prediction model.

Lower time and space expenses make it possible for scientists to search the enormous chemical space. Recently, some work combined reinforcement learning strategies with recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models to optimize the property of generated small molecules, which notably improved a batch of critical factors for these candidates. However, a common problem among these RNN-based methods is that several generated molecules have difficulty in synthesizing despite owning higher desired properties such as binding affinity. However, RNN-based framework better reproduces the molecule distribution among the training set than other categories of models during molecule exploration tasks. Thus, to optimize the whole exploration process and make it contribute to the optimization of specified molecules, we devised a light-weighted pipeline called Magicmol; this pipeline has a re-mastered RNN network and utilize SELFIES presentation instead of SMILES. Our backbone model achieved extraordinary performance while reducing the training cost; moreover, we devised reward truncate strategies to eliminate the model collapse problem.

Here, we focus on a region of the Middle East, Iraq to be specific, and conduct a detailed study on predicting locations of petroleum deposits there based on our proposed method. To do so, we develop a new method of predicting the location of a new petroleum deposit based on publicly available data sensed by an open satellite named Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Using GRACE data, we calculate the gravity gradient tensor of the earth over the region of Iraq and its surroundings. We use this calculated data to predict the locations of prospective petroleum deposits over the region of Iraq. In the process of our study for making the predictions, we leverage machine learning, graph-based analysis, and our newly-proposed OR-nAND method altogether. Our incremental improvement in the proposed methodologies enables us to predict 25 out of 26 existing petroleum deposits within the area under our study. Additionally, our method shows some prospective petroleum deposits that need to be explored physically in the future.

Given the many regulatory roles of the corresponding p53 protein, it is possible to infer loss of p53 activity – which may occur due to alterations in trans – from gene expression patterns. Several such alterations that phenocopy p53 loss are known, however additional ones may exist, but their identity and prevalence among human tumors are not well characterized. Results: We perform a large-scale statistical analysis on transcriptomes of ~ 7,000 tumors and ~ 1,000 cell lines, estimating that 12% and 8% of tumors and cancer cell lines, respectively, phenocopy TP53 loss: they are likely deficient in the activity of the p53 pathway, while not bearing obvious TP53 inactivating mutations. While some of these cases are explained by amplifications in the known phenocopying genes MDM2, MDM4 and PPM1D, many are not. An association analysis of cancer genomic scores jointly with CRISPR/RNAi genetic screening data identified an additional common TP53-loss phenocopying gene, USP28. Deletions in USP28 are associated with a TP53 functional impairment in 2.9–7.6% of breast, bladder, lung, liver and stomach tumors, and have comparable effect size to MDM4 amplifications. Additionally, in the known copy number alteration (CNA) segment harboring MDM2, we identify an additional co-amplified gene (CNOT2) that may cooperatively boost the TP53 functional inactivation effect of MDM2. An analysis of cancer cell line drug screens using phenocopy scores suggests that TP53 (in)activity commonly modulates associations between anticancer drug effects and various genetic markers, such as PIK3CA and PTEN mutations, and should thus be considered as a drug activity modifying factor in precision medicine. As a resource, we provide the drug-genetic marker associations that differ depending on TP53 functional status. Conclusions: Human tumors that do not bear obvious TP53 genetic alterations but that phenocopy p53 activity loss are common, and the USP28 gene deletions are one likely cause.",CRISPR screens | Driver genes | Drug resistance | Gene expression | p53 pathway | Transcriptomic signature | Tumor evolution,0,1,repositoryam,Green,H2020,965193,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Therefore, there is great interest in models for predicting mortality in trauma patients admitted to the ICU. The main objective of the present study is to develop and evaluate SMOTE-based machine-learning tools for predicting hospital mortality in trauma patients with imbalanced data. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 126 trauma patients admitted to an intensive care unit at Besat hospital in Hamadan Province, western Iran, from March 2020 to March 2021. Data were extracted from the medical information records of patients. According to the imbalanced property of the data, SMOTE techniques, namely SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE1, Borderline-SMOTE2, SMOTE-NC, and SVM-SMOTE, were used for primary preprocessing. Then, the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods were used to predict patients' hospital mortality with traumatic injuries. The performance of the methods used was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Geometric Mean (G-means), F1 score, and P-value of McNemar's test. Results: Of the 126 patients admitted to an ICU, 117 (92.9%) survived and 9 (7.1%) died. The mean follow-up time from the date of trauma to the date of outcome was 3.98 ± 4.65 days. The performance of ML algorithms is not good with imbalanced data, whereas the performance of SMOTE-based ML algorithms is significantly improved. The mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of all SMOTE-based models was more than 91%. F1-score and G-means before balancing the dataset were below 70% for all ML models except ANN. In contrast, F1-score and G-means for the balanced datasets reached more than 90% for all SMOTE-based models. Among all SMOTE-based ML methods, RF and ANN based on SMOTE and XGBoost based on SMOTE-NC achieved the highest value for all evaluation criteria. Conclusions: This study has shown that SMOTE-based ML algorithms better predict outcomes in traumatic injuries than ML algorithms.

Despite the expanded availability of antiretroviral therapy around the world, virological failure remains a serious problem for HIV-positive patients. Thus, Machine learning predictive algorithms have the potential to improve the quality of care and predict the needs of HIV patients by analyzing huge amounts of data, and enhancing prediction capabilities. This study used different machine learning classification algorithms to predict the features that cause virological failure in HIV-positive patients. Method: An institution-based secondary data was used to conduct patients who were on antiretroviral therapy at the University of Gondar Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital from January 2020 to May 2022. Patients’ data were extracted from the electronic database using a structured checklist and imported into Python version three software for data pre-processing and analysis. Then, seven supervised classification machine-learning algorithms for model development were trained. The performances of the predictive models were evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1-score, and AUC. Association rule mining was used to generate the best rule for the association between independent features and the target feature. Result: Out of 5264 study participants, 1893 (35.06%) males and 3371 (64.04%) females were included.

The proposed technique is based on a similar principle that underlies electroencephalography (EEG): averaging of neural (artificial or biological) activity across neurons in the time domain, and allows to compare encoding of any acoustic property in the brain and in intermediate convolutional layers of an artificial neural network. Our approach allows a direct comparison of responses to a phonetic property in the brain and in deep neural networks that requires no linear transformations between the signals. We argue that the brain stem response (cABR) and the response in intermediate convolutional layers to the exact same stimulus are highly similar without applying any transformations, and we quantify this observation. The proposed technique not only reveals similarities, but also allows for analysis of the encoding of actual acoustic properties in the two signals: we compare peak latency (i) in cABR relative to the stimulus in the brain stem and in (ii) intermediate convolutional layers relative to the input/output in deep convolutional networks. We also examine and compare the effect of prior language exposure on the peak latency in cABR and in intermediate convolutional layers. Substantial similarities in peak latency encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional networks emerge based on results from eight trained networks (including a replication experiment).

DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity.

Additionally, we use a novel multichannel quad-tree algorithm to estimate atmospheric light values, which is more accurate than previous methods. Furthermore, the sum of the cosine distance and the mean squared error between the pseudo-label and the input image is applied as a loss function to enhance the quality of the dehazed image. The most significant advantage of the SZDNet is that it does not require a large dataset for training before performing the dehazing task. Extensive testing shows promising performances of the proposed method in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Subsequently, a cluster ball model is proposed to merge two clusters in the random samples that are likely sampled from the same cluster in the big dataset.

Their structure and molecular size render them a unique chemical space, between small molecules and larger proteins. Peptides have important physiological functions as intrinsic signalling molecules, such as neuropeptides and peptide hormones, for cellular or interspecies communication, as toxins to catch prey or as defence molecules to fend off enemies and microorganisms.

However, whether designed by AI or human experts, the molecules need to be accessibly synthesized and biologically evaluated, and the trial-and-error process remains a resources-intensive endeavor. Therefore, AI-based drug design methods face a major challenge of how to prioritize the molecular structures with potential for subsequent drug development. This study indicates that common filtering approaches based on traditional screening metrics fail to differentiate AI-designed molecules. To address this issue, we propose a novel molecular filtering method, MolFilterGAN, based on a progressively augmented generative adversarial network. Comparative analysis shows that MolFilterGAN outperforms conventional screening approaches based on drug-likeness or synthetic ability metrics. Retrospective analysis of AI-designed discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) inhibitors shows that MolFilterGAN significantly increases the efficiency of molecular triaging. Further evaluation of MolFilterGAN on eight external ligand sets suggests that MolFilterGAN is useful in triaging or enriching bioactive compounds across a wide range of target types.

The goal of this study was to develop a data processing workflow by leveraging 3D deep learning models and a novel 3D data annotation tool to segment cotton plant parts and derive important architectural traits. Results: The Point Voxel Convolutional Neural Network (PVCNN) combining both point- and voxel-based representations of 3D data shows less time consumption and better segmentation performance than point-based networks.

Recent data science and machine learning techniques support the development of new ways to extract value from the available reaction data.

In this context, the need to combine, compare and analyze synthetic routes generated by different sources arises naturally. Results: Here we present LinChemIn, a python toolkit that allows chemoinformatics operations on synthetic routes and reaction networks. Wrapping some third-party packages for handling graph arithmetic and chemoinformatics and implementing new data models and functionalities, LinChemIn allows the interconversion between data formats and data models and enables route-level analysis and operations, including route comparison and descriptors calculation. Object-Oriented Design principles inspire the software architecture, and the modules are structured to maximize code reusability and support code testing and refactoring. The code structure should facilitate external contributions, thus encouraging open and collaborative software development. Conclusions: The current version of LinChemIn allows users to combine synthetic routes generated from various tools and analyze them, and constitutes an open and extensible framework capable of incorporating contributions from the community and fostering scientific discussion.

To this end, we propose MRXCAT2.0 to generate synthetic data, covering healthy and pathological function, using a biophysical model. We exemplify the approach by generating cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images of healthy, infarcted, dilated and hypertrophic left-ventricular (LV) function. Method: In MRXCAT2.0, the XCAT torso phantom is coupled with a statistical shape model, describing population (patho)physiological variability, and a biophysical model, providing known and detailed functional ground truth of LV morphology and function. CMR balanced steady-state free precession images are generated using MRXCAT2.0 while realistic image appearance is ensured by assigning texturized tissue properties to the phantom labels. Finding: Paired CMR image and ground truth data of LV function were generated with a range of LV masses (85–140 g), ejection fractions (34–51%) and peak radial and circumferential strains (0.45 to 0.95 and − 0.18 to − 0.13, respectively). These ranges cover healthy and pathological cases, including infarction, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The generation of the anatomy takes a few seconds and it improves on current state-of-the-art models where the pathological representation is not explicitly addressed. For the full simulation framework, the biophysical models require approximately two hours, while image generation requires a few minutes per slice.

The present investigation created a model based on machine learning for predictive analysis of mortality in patients with AMI upon admission, using different variables to analyse their impact on predictive models. Methods: Three experiments were built for mortality in AMI in a Portuguese hospital between 2013 and 2015 using various machine learning techniques. The three experiments differed in the number and type of variables used. We used a discharged patients’ episodes database, including administrative data, laboratory data, and cardiac and physiologic test results, whose primary diagnosis was AMI. Results: Results show that for Experiment 1, Stochastic Gradient Descent was more suitable than the other classification models, with a classification accuracy of 80%, a recall of 77%, and a discriminatory capacity with an AUC of 79%. Adding new variables to the models increased AUC in Experiment 2 to 81% for the Support Vector Machine method. In Experiment 3, we obtained an AUC, in Stochastic Gradient Descent, of 88% and a recall of 80%. These results were obtained when applying feature selection and the SMOTE technique to overcome imbalanced data. Conclusions: Our results show that the introduction of new variables, namely laboratory data, impacts the performance of the methods, reinforcing the premise that no single approach is adapted to all situations regarding AMI mortality prediction. Instead, they must be selected, considering the context and the information available.

A tilt correction approach is also designed and implemented to rectify potential inaccuracy in pole length estimation caused by tilted stop signs in floodwaters. The mean absolute error (MAE) achieved for pole length estimation in pre- and post-flood photos is 1.723 and 2.846 in., respectively, leading to an MAE of 4.710 in. for flood depth estimation. The presented approach provides people and first responders with a reliable and geographically scalable solution for estimating and communicating real-time flood depth data at their locations.",Crowdsourcing | Deep learning | Flood | Floodwater depth | Semantic segmentation | Traffic signage,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,DOC,undefined,U.S. Department of Commerce

However, building machine learning algorithms robust to inter- and intra-radiologist segmentation variability is still a challenge. With this goal in mind, several model training approaches were compared: removing unstable features according to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); training independently with features extracted from each radiologist’s mask; training with the feature average between both radiologists; extracting radiomic features from the intersection or union of masks; and creating a heterogeneous dataset by randomly selecting one of the radiologists’ masks for each patient. The classifier trained with this last resampled dataset presented with the lowest generalization error, suggesting that training with heterogeneous data leads to the development of the most robust classifiers. On the contrary, removing features with low ICC resulted in the highest generalization error. The selected radiomics dataset, with the randomly chosen radiologists, was concatenated with deep features extracted from neural networks trained to segment the whole prostate.

An intelligent assessment approach for classifying weathering degree of building sandstone in a humid environment is presented in this study.

At first, weathering process is divided into initial weathered stage, accelerated weathered stage, and stable weathered stage according to the causes and mechanisms of weathering. Secondly, a novel classification method of weathering degree is proposed based on the weathering stage. Then, the mapping relationship between microscopic characteristics and hyperspectral image of shedding samples can be established in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges (400–1000 nm) according to the change law of spectral absorption feature. Next, the spectral data of building sandstone with different weathering degrees are classified using Random Forest model. Furthermore, the hyperparameters of Random Forest model are optimized by Gray Wolf Optimizer algorithm for better performance.

The analysis of time to event, which is crucial for any clinical research, can be well done with the method of survival prediction. This study aims to systematically investigate the use of machine learning to predict survival in patients with cervical cancer. Method: An electronic search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed on October 1, 2022. All articles extracted from the databases were collected in an Excel file and duplicate articles were removed. The articles were screened twice based on the title and the abstract and checked again with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main inclusion criterion was machine learning algorithms for predicting cervical cancer survival. The information extracted from the articles included authors, publication year, dataset details, survival type, evaluation criteria, machine learning models, and the algorithm execution method. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in this study, most of which were published from 2018 onwards. The most common machine learning models were random forest (6 articles, 46%), logistic regression (4 articles, 30%), support vector machines (3 articles, 23%), ensemble and hybrid learning (3 articles, 23%), and Deep Learning (3 articles, 23%). The number of sample datasets in the study varied between 85 and 14946 patients, and the models were internally validated except for two articles.

A recently developed Bayesian computational framework for enzyme and temperature constrained genome-scale models (etcGEM) predicts the temperature dependence of an organism’s metabolic network from thermodynamic properties of the metabolic enzymes, markedly expanding the scope and applicability of constraint-based metabolic modelling. Here, we show that the Bayesian calculation method for inferring parameters for an etcGEM is unstable and unable to estimate the posterior distribution. The Bayesian calculation method assumes that the posterior distribution is unimodal, and thus fails due to the multimodality of the problem. To remedy this problem, we developed an evolutionary algorithm which is able to obtain a diversity of solutions in this multimodal parameter space. We quantified the phenotypic consequences on six metabolic network signature reactions of the different parameter solutions resulting from use of the evolutionary algorithm. While two of these reactions showed little phenotypic variation between the solutions, the remainder displayed huge variation in flux-carrying capacity.

This paper presents a novel method for recognizing small fishing vessels based on laser sensors. Using four types of small fishing vessels as targets, a recognition method for small fishing vessels based on Markov transition field (MTF) time-series images and VGG-16 transfer learning is proposed. In contrast to conventional methods, this study uses polynomial fitting to obtain the contours of a fishing vessel and transforms one-dimensional vessel contours into two-dimensional time-series images using the MTF coding method. The VGG-16 model is used for the recognition process, and migration learning is applied to improve the results. The UCR time-series public dataset is used as a transfer learning dataset for the MTF time-series image encoding. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits higher accuracy and performance than 1D-CNN and other general neural network models, and the highest accuracy rate is 98.92%.",,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,62002146,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption habit changes among healthcare workers in the United States during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We utilize multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models such as decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Chi-Squared Test, mutual information, KModes clustering and the synthetic minority oversampling technique on a mental health survey data obtained from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research to investigate the links between COVID-19-related deleterious effects and changes in alcohol consumption habits among healthcare workers. Through the interpretation of the supervised and unsupervised methods, we have concluded that healthcare workers whose children stayed home during the first wave in the US consumed more alcohol. We also found that the work schedule changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to a change in alcohol use habits. Changes in food consumption, age, gender, geographical characteristics, changes in sleep habits, the amount of news consumption, and screen time are also important predictors of an increase in alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.",,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

A large number of studies have focused on the splicing inclusion of alternative exons and have revealed the roles of AS in organ development and maturation. Notably, AS takes place through a change in the relative abundance of the transcript isoforms produced by a single gene, meaning that exons can have complex splicing patterns. However, the commonly used percent spliced-in (Ψ) values only define the usage rate of exons, but lose information about the complexity of exons’ linkage pattern. To date, the extent and functional consequence of splicing complexity of alternative exons in development and evolution is poorly understood. Results: By comparing splicing complexity of exons in six tissues (brain, cerebellum, heart, liver, kidney, and testis) from six mammalian species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, macaque, mouse, opossum) and an outgroup species (chicken), we revealed that exons with high splicing complexity are prevalent in mammals and are closely related to features of genes. Using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods, we found that the splicing complexity of exons can be moderately predicted with features derived from exons, among which length of flanking exons and splicing strength of downstream/upstream splice sites are top predictors. Comparative analysis among human, chimpanzee, gorilla, macaque, and mouse revealed that, alternative exons tend to evolve to an increased level of splicing complexity and higher tissue specificity in splicing complexity. During organ development, not only developmentally regulated exons, but also 10–15% of non-developmentally regulated exons show dynamic splicing complexity. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that splicing complexity is an important metric to characterize the splicing dynamics of alternative exons during the development and evolution of mammals.",Alternative splicing | Development and evolution | Machine learning | Splicing complexity,0,1,,,NWAFU,A289021612,Northwest A and F University

Since the ground truth is inaccessible in real world data, simulation studies using synthetic datasets that mimic complex clinical environments are essential. We describe and evaluate a generalizable framework for injecting hierarchical learning effects within a robust data generation process that incorporates the magnitude of intrinsic risk and accounts for known critical elements in clinical data relationships. Methods: We present a multi-step data generating process with customizable options and flexible modules to support a variety of simulation requirements. Synthetic patients with nonlinear and correlated features are assigned to provider and institution case series. The probability of treatment and outcome assignment are associated with patient features based on user definitions. Risk due to experiential learning by providers and/or institutions when novel treatments are introduced is injected at various speeds and magnitudes. To further reflect real-world complexity, users can request missing values and omitted variables. We illustrate an implementation of our method in a case study using MIMIC-III data for reference patient feature distributions. Results: Realized data characteristics in the simulated data reflected specified values. Apparent deviations in treatment effects and feature distributions, though not statistically significant, were most common in small datasets (n < 3000) and attributable to random noise and variability in estimating realized values in small samples. When learning effects were specified, synthetic datasets exhibited changes in the probability of an adverse outcomes as cases accrued for the treatment group impacted by learning and stable probabilities as cases accrued for the treatment group not affected by learning. Conclusions: Our framework extends clinical data simulation techniques beyond generation of patient features to incorporate hierarchical learning effects. This enables the complex simulation studies required to develop and rigorously test algorithms developed to disentangle treatment safety signals from the effects of experiential learning. By supporting such efforts, this work can help identify training opportunities, avoid unwarranted restriction of access to medical advances, and hasten treatment improvements.",Hierarchical learning effects | Learning effects | Medical devices | Post-market safety surveillance | Simulations | Synthetic clinical data,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NHLBI,1R01HL149948,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"

Given the practicability of these approaches accordingly, various software packages have been also designed and developed. However, the existing methods suffer from several limitations such as overfitting on a specific dataset, ignoring the feature selection concept in the preprocessing step, and losing their performance on large-size datasets. To tackle the mentioned restrictions, in this study, we introduced a machine learning framework consisting of two main steps. First, our previously suggested optimization algorithm (Trader) was extended to select a near-optimal subset of features/genes. Second, a voting-based framework was proposed to classify the biological/clinical data with high accuracy. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, it was applied to 13 biological/clinical datasets, and the outcomes were comprehensively compared with the prior methods. Results: The results demonstrated that the Trader algorithm could select a near-optimal subset of features with a significant level of p-value < 0.01 relative to the compared algorithms. Additionally, on the large-sie datasets, the proposed machine learning framework improved prior studies by ~ 10% in terms of the mean values associated with fivefold cross-validation of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F-measure. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that a proper configuration of efficient algorithms and methods can increase the prediction power of machine learning approaches and help researchers in designing practical diagnosis health care systems and offering effective treatment plans.",Clinical datasets | Feature selection | Gene selection | Machine learning | Optimization algorithm | Voting-based approach,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

With the rise of Big Data and predictive analytics, a growing body of work in higher education research has demonstrated the feasibility of predicting student dropout from readily available macro-level (e.g., socio-demographics or early performance metrics) and micro-level data (e.g., logins to learning management systems). Yet, the existing work has largely overlooked a critical meso-level element of student success known to drive retention: students’ experience at university and their social embeddedness within their cohort. In partnership with a mobile application that facilitates communication between students and universities, we collected both (1) institutional macro-level data and (2) behavioral micro and meso-level engagement data (e.g., the quantity and quality of interactions with university services and events as well as with other students) to predict dropout after the first semester. Analyzing the records of 50,095 students from four US universities and community colleges, we demonstrate that the combined macro and meso-level data can predict dropout with high levels of predictive performance (average AUC across linear and non-linear models = 78%; max AUC = 88%). Behavioral engagement variables representing students’ experience at university (e.g., network centrality, app engagement, event ratings) were found to add incremental predictive power beyond institutional variables (e.g., GPA or ethnicity). Finally, we highlight the generalizability of our results by showing that models trained on one university can predict retention at another university with reasonably high levels of predictive performance.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Methods: In this study, a stacking ensemble model comprised of four base learners (ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and artificial neural network) and a meta learner (elastic net) was proposed for predicting the daily number of hospital admissions (HAs) for CD using the historical HAs data, air quality data, and meteorological data in Chengdu, China from 2015 to 2018. To solve the label imbalance problem, a re-weighting method based on label distribution smoothing was integrated into the meta learner. We trained the model using the data from 2015 to 2017 and evaluated its predictive ability using the data in 2018 based on four metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was applied to provide explanation for the prediction of our stacking model. Results: Our proposed model outperformed all the base learners and long short-term memory (LSTM) on two datasets. Particularly, compared with the optimal results obtained by individual models, the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of the stacking model decreased by 13.9%, 12.7%, and 5.8%, respectively, and the R2 improved by 6.8% on CD dataset. The model explanation demonstrated that environmental features played a role in further improving the model performance and identified that high temperature and high concentrations of gaseous air pollutants might strongly associate with an increased risk of CD. Conclusions: Our stacking model considering environmental exposure is efficient in predicting daily HAs for CD and has practical value in early warning and healthcare resource allocation.",Cerebrovascular disease | Environmental exposure | Hospital admissions | SHAP value | Stacking ensemble model,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,71661167005,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Although such synonymous codons do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, their selection can dramatically affect the expression of the resulting protein. Codon optimization of synthetic DNA sequences is important for heterologous expression. However, existing solutions are primarily based on choosing high-frequency codons only, neglecting the important effects of rare codons. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent-neural-network based codon optimization tool, ICOR, that aims to learn codon usage bias on a genomic dataset of Escherichia coli. We compile a dataset of over 7,000 non-redundant, high-expression, robust genes which are used for deep learning. The model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory-based architecture, allowing for the sequential context of codon usage in genes to be learned. Our tool can predict synonymous codons for synthetic genes toward optimal expression in Escherichia coli. Results: We demonstrate that sequential context achieved via RNN may yield codon selection that is more similar to the host genome. Based on computational metrics that predict protein expression, ICOR theoretically optimizes protein expression more than frequency-based approaches. ICOR is evaluated on 1,481 Escherichia coli genes as well as a benchmark set of 40 select DNA sequences whose heterologous expression has been previously characterized. ICOR’s performance is measured across five metrics: the Codon Adaptation Index, GC-content, negative repeat elements, negative cis-regulatory elements, and codon frequency distribution. Conclusions: The results, based on in silico metrics, indicate that ICOR codon optimization is theoretically more effective in enhancing recombinant expression of proteins over other established codon optimization techniques.

This study aims to determine how cytokines influence the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the plasma levels of 48 cytokines in the blood of 87 participants in the COVID-19 study. Several Classifiers were trained and evaluated using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to complete missing data, generate synthetic data, and fill in any gaps. To examine the relationship between cytokine storm and COVID-19 severity in patients, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) and the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model were applied. Individuals with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had elevated plasma levels of VEGF-A, MIP-1b, and IL-17. RANTES and TNF were associated with healthy individuals, whereas IL-27, IL-9, IL-12p40, and MCP-3 were associated with non-Severity. These findings suggest that these cytokines may promote the development of novel preventive and therapeutic pathways for disease management. In this study, the use of artificial intelligence is intended to support clinical diagnoses of patients to determine how each cytokine may be responsible for the severity of COVID-19, which could lead to the identification of several cytokines that could aid in treatment decision-making and vaccine development.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Therefore, this study aims to compare and select optimal machine learning (ML)-based models for stratifying the malignant transformation status of patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis. One thousand one hundred and eighty-seven patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis treated at three tertiary health institutions in Hong Kong, Newcastle UK, and Lagos Nigeria were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, pathological, and treatment-based factors obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up were used to populate and compare forty-six machine learning-based models. These were implemented as a set of twenty-six predictors for centers with substantial data quantity and fifteen predictors for centers with insufficient data. Two best models were selected according to the number of variables. We found that the optimal ML-based risk models with twenty-six and fifteen predictors achieved an accuracy of 97% and 94% respectively following model testing. Upon external validation, both models achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of 1, 0.88, and 0.67 on consecutive patients treated after the construction of the models. Furthermore, the 15-predictor ML model for centers with reduced data achieved a higher sensitivity for identifying oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis patients that developed malignancies in other treatment settings compared to the binary oral epithelial dysplasia system for risk stratification (0.96 vs 0.82).

However, collecting samples and training neural networks are fundamentally confined to predefined individual metamaterials and tend to fail for large problem sizes. Inspired by object-oriented C++ programming, we propose a knowledge-inherited paradigm for multi-object and shape-unbound metasurface inverse design. Each inherited neural network carries knowledge from the “parent” metasurface and then is freely assembled to construct the “offspring” metasurface; such a process is as simple as building a container-type house. We benchmark the paradigm by the free design of aperiodic and periodic metasurfaces, with accuracies that reach 86.7%. Furthermore, we present an intelligent origami metasurface to facilitate compatible and lightweight satellite communication facilities.

In this paper, we propose a full pipeline relying on unsupervised methods to distinguish specific hate speech manifestations, i.e. targeted (group of) victim(s) and the protected characteristics (target-types) discriminated. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we leverage multiple data views to contrast different abusive behaviours; (2) we explore the use of clustering techniques to perform fine-grained hate speech target community detection, and (3) we address an in-depth content analysis of the generated hate speech target communities. Relying on multiple data views derived from multilingual pre-trained language models (i.e. multilingual BERT and multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder) and the Multi-view Spectral Clustering (MvSC) algorithm, the 69 experiments performed on the Multilingual Hate Speech dataset (MLMA) of tweets show that most of the configurations of the proposed pipeline significantly outperform state-of-the-art clustering algorithms on French and English.

Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the microbiome profiles present in the human body have become publicly available. Hence, many works have been done to analyze human microbiome profiles. These works have identified that different microbiome profiles are present in healthy and sick individuals for different diseases. Recently, several computational methods have utilized the microbiome profiles to automatically diagnose and classify the host phenotype. Results: In this work, a novel deep learning framework based on boosting GraphSAGE is proposed for automatic prediction of diseases from metagenomic data. The proposed framework has two main components, (a). Metagenomic Disease graph (MD-graph) construction module, (b). Disease prediction Network (DP-Net) module. The graph construction module constructs a graph by considering each metagenomic sample as a node in the graph. The graph captures the relationship between the samples using a proximity measure. The DP-Net consists of a boosting GraphSAGE model which predicts the status of a sample as sick or healthy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real and synthetic datasets corresponding to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. The proposed model achieved a highest AUC of 93%, Accuracy of 95%, F1-score of 95%, AUPRC of 95% for the real inflammatory bowel disease dataset and a best AUC of 90%, Accuracy of 91%, F1-score of 87% and AUPRC of 93% for the real colorectal cancer dataset.

Advanced machine learning analytics in conjunction with information-rich dense multi-omics data have the ability to overcome such challenges. We have developed a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI)-based optimal decision-making framework for assisting oncologists in DTR. In this work, we demonstrate the proposed framework to Knowledge Based Response-Adaptive Radiotherapy (KBR-ART) applications by developing an interactive software tool entitled Adaptive Radiotherapy Clinical Decision Support (ARCliDS). ARCliDS is composed of two main components: Artifcial RT Environment (ARTE) and Optimal Decision Maker (ODM). ARTE is designed as a Markov decision process and modeled via supervised learning. Given a patient’s pre- and during-treatment information, ARTE can estimate treatment outcomes for a selected daily dosage value (radiation fraction size). ODM is formulated using reinforcement learning and is trained on ARTE. ODM can recommend optimal daily dosage adjustments to maximize the tumor local control probability and minimize the side effects. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are applied to exploit the inter-feature relationships for improved modeling performance and a novel double GNN architecture is designed to avoid nonphysical treatment response. Datasets of size 117 and 292 were available from two clinical trials on adaptive RT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and adaptive stereotactic body RT (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, respectively. For training and validation, dense data with 297 features were available for 67 NSCLC patients and 110 features for 71 HCC patients. To increase the sample size for ODM training, we applied Generative Adversarial Networks to generate 10,000 synthetic patients. The ODM was trained on the synthetic patients and validated on the original dataset. We found that, Double GNN architecture was able to correct the nonphysical dose-response trend and improve ARCliDS recommendation. The average root mean squared difference (RMSD) between ARCliDS recommendation and reported clinical decisions using double GNNs were 0.61 [0.03] Gy/frac (mean [sem]) for adaptive RT in NSCLC patients and 2.96 [0.42] Gy/frac for adaptive SBRT HCC compared to the single GNN’s RMSDs of 0.97 [0.12] Gy/frac and 4.75 [0.16] Gy/frac, respectively. Overall, For NSCLC and HCC, ARCliDS with double GNNs was able to reproduce 36% and 50% of the good clinical decisions (local control and no side effects) and improve 74% and 30% of the bad clinical decisions, respectively. In conclusion, ARCliDS is the first web-based software dedicated to assist KBR-ART with multi-omics data. ARCliDS can learn from the reported clinical decisions and facilitate AI-assisted clinical decision-making for improving the outcomes in DTR.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NIH,P01 CA59827,National Institutes of Health

The aim of this study was to establish a prediction model using PROs for out-of-hospital patients. Methods: CHF-PRO were collected in 941 patients with CHF from a prospective cohort. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). To establish prognosis models during the two years follow-up, six machine learning methods were used, including logistic regression, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine, naive bayes, and multilayer perceptron. Models were established in four steps, namely, using general information as predictors, using four domains of CHF-PRO, using both of them and adjusting the parameters. The discrimination and calibration were then estimated. Further analyze were performed for the best model. The top prediction variables were further assessed. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used to explain black boxes of the models. Moreover, a self-made web-based risk calculator was established to facilitate the clinical application. Results: CHF-PRO showed strong prediction value and improved the performance of the models. Among the approaches, XGBoost of the parameter adjustment model had the highest prediction performance with an area under the curve of 0.754 (95% CI: 0.737 to 0.761) for death, 0.718 (95% CI: 0.717 to 0.721) for HF rehospitalization and 0.670 (95% CI: 0.595 to 0.710) for MACEs. The four domains of CHF-PRO, especially the physical domain, showed the most significant impact on the prediction of outcomes. Conclusion: CHF-PRO showed strong prediction value in the models. The XGBoost models using variables based on CHF-PRO and the patient’s general information provide prognostic assessment for patients with CHF. The self-made web-based risk calculator can be conveniently used to predict the prognosis for patients after discharge.

The glycan molecule can induce impressive current blockages when moving through the nanopore after being connected with an aromatic group-containing tag (plus a carrier group for the neutral glycan). The obtained nanopore data permit the identification of glycan regio- and stereoisomers, glycans with variable monosaccharide numbers, and distinct branched glycans, either independently or with the use of machine learning methods.

Here, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based CT-free quantitative thyroid SPECT that can generate an attenuation map (μ-map) and automatically segment the thyroid. Methods: Quantitative thyroid SPECT/CT data (n = 650) were retrospectively analyzed. Typical 3D U-Nets were used for the μ-map generation and automatic thyroid segmentation. Primary emission and scattering SPECTs were inputted to generate a μ-map, and the original μ-map from CT was labeled (268 and 30 for training and validation, respectively). The generated μ-map and primary emission SPECT were inputted for the automatic thyroid segmentation, and the manual thyroid segmentation was labeled (280 and 36 for training and validation, respectively). Other thyroid SPECT/CT (n = 36) and salivary SPECT/CT (n = 29) were employed for verification. Results: The synthetic μ-map demonstrated a strong correlation (R2 = 0.972) and minimum error (mean square error = 0.936 × 10−4, %normalized mean absolute error = 0.999%) of attenuation coefficients when compared to the ground truth (n = 30). Compared to manual segmentation, the automatic thyroid segmentation was excellent with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.767, minimal thyroid volume difference of − 0.72 mL, and a short 95% Hausdorff distance of 9.416 mm (n = 36). Additionally, %thyroid uptake by synthetic μ-map and automatic thyroid segmentation (CT-free SPECT) was similar to that by the original μ-map and manual thyroid segmentation (SPECT/CT) (3.772 ± 5.735% vs. 3.682 ± 5.516%, p = 0.1090) (n = 36). Furthermore, the synthetic μ-map generation and automatic thyroid segmentation were successfully performed in the salivary SPECT/CT using the deep-learning algorithms trained by thyroid SPECT/CT (n = 29).

In a previous fMRI study using an explicit emotion regulation paradigm, we compared responses from 19 BD-I patients and 17 matched healthy controls (HC). A standard general linear model-based univariate analysis revealed that BD patients showed increased activations in inferior frontal gyrus when instructed to decrease their emotional response as elicited by neutral images. We implemented multivariate pattern recognition analyses on the same data to examine if we could classify conditions within-group as well as HC versus BD. Methods: We reanalyzed explicit emotion regulation data using a multivariate pattern recognition approach, as implemented in PRONTO software. The original experimental paradigm consisted of a full 2 × 2 factorial design, with valence (Negative/Neutral) and instruction (Look/Decrease) as within subject factors. Results: The multivariate models were able to accurately classify different task conditions when HC and BD were analyzed separately (63.24%–75.00%, p = 0.001–0.012). In addition, the models were able to correctly classify HC versus BD with significant accuracy in conditions where subjects were instructed to downregulate their felt emotion (59.60%–60.84%, p = 0.014–0.018). The results for HC versus BD classification demonstrated contributions from the salience network, several occipital and frontal regions, inferior parietal lobes, as well as other cortical regions, to achieve above-chance classifications. Conclusions: Our multivariate analysis successfully reproduced some of the main results obtained in the previous univariate analysis, confirming that these findings are not dependent on the analysis approach. In particular, both types of analyses suggest that there is a significant difference of neural patterns between conditions within each subject group. The multivariate approach also revealed that reappraisal conditions provide the most informative activity for differentiating HC versus BD, irrespective of emotional valence (negative or neutral). The current results illustrate the importance of investigating the cognitive control of emotion in BD. We also propose a set of candidate regions for further study of emotional control in BD.",Bipolar disorder | Emotion regulation | fMRI | Multivariate pattern analysis | Reappraisal,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,IRSC,MOP-130516,Canadian Institutes of Health Research

This setting is fundamentally correlative, as those models are exposed during training solely to the sequence variation between human genes that arose through evolution, questioning the extent to which those models capture genuine causal signals. Results: Here we confront predictions of state-of-the-art models of transcription regulation against data from two large-scale observational studies and five deep perturbation assays. The most advanced of these sequence-based models, Enformer, by and large, captures causal determinants of human promoters. However, models fail to capture the causal effects of enhancers on expression, notably in medium to long distances and particularly for highly expressed promoters. More generally, the predicted impact of distal elements on gene expression predictions is small and the ability to correctly integrate long-range information is significantly more limited than the receptive fields of the models suggest. This is likely caused by the escalating class imbalance between actual and candidate regulatory elements as distance increases. Conclusions: Our results suggest that sequence-based models have advanced to the point that in silico study of promoter regions and promoter variants can provide meaningful insights and we provide practical guidance on how to use them. Moreover, we foresee that it will require significantly more and particularly new kinds of data to train models accurately accounting for distal elements.",Deep learning | Enhancer | Gene expression | Promoter | Transcription | Variant effect,0,1,repositoryam,Green,BMBF,031L0174A,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung

In this pathological state, a widely reported form of activity are spiral waves that travel in a circular pattern around a fixed spatial locus termed the center of mass. Spiral waves exhibit stereotypical activity and involve broad patterns of co-fluctuations, suggesting that they may be of lower complexity than healthy activity. Results: To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed dense multi-electrode recordings of cortical networks where disinhibition was induced by perfusing a pro-epileptiform solution containing 4-Aminopyridine as well as increased potassium and decreased magnesium. Spiral waves were identified based on a spatially delimited center of mass and a broad distribution of instantaneous phases across electrodes. Individual waves were decomposed into “snapshots” that captured instantaneous neural activation across the entire network. The complexity of these snapshots was examined using a measure termed the participation ratio. Contrary to our expectations, an eigenspectrum analysis of these snapshots revealed a broad distribution of eigenvalues and an increase in complexity compared to baseline networks. A deep generative adversarial network was trained to generate novel exemplars of snapshots that closely captured cortical spiral waves. These synthetic waves replicated key features of experimental data including a tight center of mass, a broad eigenvalue distribution, spatially-dependent correlations, and a high complexity. By adjusting the input to the model, new samples were generated that deviated in systematic ways from the experimental data, thus allowing the exploration of a broad range of states from healthy to pathologically disinhibited neural networks. Conclusions: Together, results show that the complexity of population activity serves as a marker along a continuum from healthy to disinhibited brain states. The proposed generative adversarial network opens avenues for replicating the dynamics of cortical seizures and accelerating the design of optimal neurostimulation aimed at suppressing pathological brain activity.",Complexity | Deep neural network | Epilepsy | Multi electrodes,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSERC,210977,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We assess how similar our synthetic data is to the real data using utility assessments that assess the structure and general patterns in the data as well as by recreating a specific analysis in the real data commonly applied to this type of administrative health data. We also assess the privacy risks associated with the use of this synthetic dataset. Generic utility assessments that used Hellinger distance to quantify the difference in distributions between real and synthetic datasets for event types (0.027), attributes (mean 0.0417), Markov transition matrices (order 1 mean absolute difference: 0.0896, sd: 0.159; order 2: mean Hellinger distance 0.2195, sd: 0.2724), the Hellinger distance between the joint distributions was 0.352, and the similarity of random cohorts generated from real and synthetic data had a mean Hellinger distance of 0.3 and mean Euclidean distance of 0.064, indicating small differences between the distributions in the real data and the synthetic data. By applying a realistic analysis to both real and synthetic datasets, Cox regression hazard ratios achieved a mean confidence interval overlap of 68% for adjusted hazard ratios among 5 key outcomes of interest, indicating synthetic data produces similar analytic results to real data. The privacy assessment concluded that the attribution disclosure risk associated with this synthetic dataset was substantially less than the typical 0.09 acceptable risk threshold. Based on these metrics our results show that our synthetic data is suitably similar to the real data and could be shared for research purposes thereby alleviating concerns associated with the sharing of real data in some circumstances.",Administrative health data | Data privacy | Data sharing | Synthetic data,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,BMGF,RGPIN-2016-06781,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

For this purpose, data from the Korea Employment Information Service's Job Mobility Survey (Graduates Occupations Mobility Survey: GOMS) for college graduates were used. This data includes various items such as turnover intention, personal characteristics, and job characteristics of new college graduates, and the class ratio of turnover intention is imbalanced. For solving the imbalance data problem, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were used to balance class variables to examine the improvement of turnover intention prediction accuracy. After deriving the factors affecting the turnover intention by referring to previous studies, a turnover intention prediction model was constructed, and the model's prediction accuracy was analyzed by reflecting each data. As a result of the analysis, the highest predictive accuracy was found in class balanced data through generative adversarial networks rather than class imbalanced original data and class balanced data through SMOTE. The academic implication of this study is that first, the diversity of data sampling methods was presented by expanding and applying GAN, which are widely used in unstructured data sampling fields such as images and images, to structured data in business administration fields such as this study. Second, two refining processes were performed on data generated using generative adversarial networks to suggest a method for refining only data corresponding to a more minority class. The practical implication of this study is that it suggested a plan to predict the turnover intention of new college graduates early through the establishment of a predictive model using public data and machine learning.",Generative adversarial networks | Imbalanced data | SMOTE | Turnover intention,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

A major challenge for materials scientists and metallurgists at this stage is to predict their crystal structure and, therefore, their mechanical properties to reduce experimental efforts, which are energy and time intensive. Through this paper, we show that it is possible to use machine learning (ML) in this arena for phase prediction to develop novel HEAs. We tested five robust algorithms namely, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree classifier (DTC), random forest classifier (RFC) and XGBoost (XGB) in their vanilla form (base models) on a large dataset screened specifically from experimental data concerning HEA fabrication using melting and casting manufacturing methods. This was necessary to avoid the discrepancy inherent with comparing HEAs obtained from different synthesis routes as it causes spurious effects while treating an imbalanced data—an erroneous practice we observed in the reported literature. We found that (i) RFC model predictions were more reliable in contrast to other models and (ii) the synthetic data augmentation is not a neat practice in materials science specially to develop HEAs, where it cannot assure phase information reliably. To substantiate our claim, we compared the vanilla RFC (V-RFC) model for original data (1200 datasets) with SMOTE-Tomek links augmented RFC (ST-RFC) model for the new datasets (1200 original + 192 generated = 1392 datasets). We found that although the ST-RFC model showed a higher average test accuracy of 92%, no significant breakthroughs were observed, when testing the number of correct and incorrect predictions using confusion matrix and ROC-AUC scores for individual phases. Based on our RFC model, we report the development of a new HEA (Ni25Cu18.75Fe25Co25Al6.25) exhibiting an FCC phase proving the robustness of our predictions.",,0,1,repositoryam,Green,UKRI,EP/S036180/1,UK Research and Innovation

The synergy with ground-based and space-born instruments in the electromagnetic domain, by enabling multi-messenger observations, will add further to the discovery potential of LISA. The next decade is crucial to prepare the astrophysical community for LISA’s first observations. This review outlines the extensive landscape of astrophysical theory, numerical simulations, and astronomical observations that are instrumental for modeling and interpreting the upcoming LISA datastream. To this aim, the current knowledge in three main source classes for LISA is reviewed; ultra-compact stellar-mass binaries, massive black hole binaries, and extreme or interme-diate mass ratio inspirals. The relevant astrophysical processes and the established modeling techniques are summarized. Likewise, open issues and gaps in our understanding of these sources are highlighted, along with an indication of how LISA could help making progress in the different areas. New research avenues that LISA itself, or its joint exploitation with upcoming studies in the electromagnetic domain, will enable, are also illustrated. Improvements in modeling and analysis approaches, such as the combination of numerical simulations and modern data science techniques, are discussed.

Its spatial and spectral resolution continues to improve over time, and some modern satellites, such as the Copernicus Programme's Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, offer a spatial resolution of 10 m across many of their spectral bands. The abundance and quality of remote sensing data combined with accumulated primary geochemical data has provided an unprecedented opportunity to inferentially invert remote sensing data into geochemical data. The ability to derive geochemical data from remote sensing data would provide a form of secondary big geochemical data, which can be used for numerous downstream activities, particularly where data timeliness, volume and velocity are important. Major benefactors of secondary geochemical data would be environmental monitoring and applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in geochemistry, which currently entirely relies on manually derived data that is primarily guided by scientific reduction. Furthermore, it permits the usage of well-established data analysis techniques from geochemistry to remote sensing that allows useable insights to be extracted beyond those typically associated with strictly remote sensing data analysis. Currently, no generally applicable and systematic method to derive chemical elemental concentrations from large-scale remote sensing data have been documented in geosciences. In this paper, we demonstrate that fusing geostatistically-augmented geochemical and remote sensing data produces an abundance of data that enables a more generalized machine learning-based geochemical data generation. We use gold grade data from a South African tailing storage facility (TSF) and data from both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel remote sensing satellites. We show that various machine learning algorithms can be used given the abundance of training data. Consequently, we are able to produce a high resolution (10 m grid size) gold concentration map of the TSF, which demonstrates the potential of our method to be used to guide extraction planning, online resource exploration, environmental monitoring and resource estimation.",Big geochemical data | Dry labs | Machine learning | Remote sensing | Tailing storage facilities | Witwatersrand Basin,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,TSF,"121,973",Siragusa Foundation

Social media is widely used by young people with user-generated content and influencer marketing particularly influential in promoting products. This paper documents a snapshot of online user-generated content and influencer marketing related to e-cigarettes on YouTube and Instagram. Methods: Scoping review of relevant e-cigarette-related content on two social media platforms popular with youths, YouTube and Instagram, between June and August 2021. Content analysis was undertaken to examine text, audio, and video content, recording age restrictions, health warnings, page characteristics, and post characteristics. Narrative post content was coded using a coding frame that was developed inductively in response to emergent categories. Results: Vaping was portrayed positively on social media; of the posts analysed, 86.5% (n = 90 of 104) of Instagram posts and 66.0% (n = 64 of 97) of YouTube videos. Warnings about age restrictions and health (e.g., nicotine addiction/toxicity) did not feature in the majority of posts; 43.3% (n = 42) of YouTube videos (n = 42) contained an age warning compared to 20.2% of Instagram posts (n = 21). While 25.8% (n = 25) of YouTube videos and 21.2% of Instagram (n = 22) posts contained a health warning. Conclusion: Of concern is the fact that the vast majority of YouTube and Instagram content about e-cigarettes promoted their use, and typically the content does not contain age and/or health warnings. These findings may highlight a priority for governmental policy to restrict the ability of marketers to reach youths with social media content promoting e-cigarettes.",e-cigarettes | Electronic cigarettes | Social media | Vaping,0,1,repositoryam,Green,CSO,SPHSU17,"Chief Scientist Office, Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorate"

The soft electronics have huge potential in the physical sign monitoring and health care. One of the important advantages of soft electronics is forming good interface with skin, which can increase the user scale and improve the signal quality. Therefore, it is easy to build the specific dataset, which is important to improve the performance of machine learning algorithm. At the same time, with the assistance of machine learning algorithm, the soft electronics have become more and more intelligent to realize real-time analysis and diagnosis. The soft electronics and machining learning algorithms complement each other very well. It is indubitable that the soft electronics will bring us to a healthier and more intelligent world in the near future. Therefore, in this review, we will give a careful introduction about the new soft material, physiological signal detected by soft devices, and the soft devices assisted by machine learning algorithm. Some soft materials will be discussed such as two-dimensional material, carbon nanotube, nanowire, nanomesh, and hydrogel. Then, soft sensors will be discussed according to the physiological signal types (pulse, respiration, human motion, intraocular pressure, phonation, etc.). After that, the soft electronics assisted by various algorithms will be reviewed, including some classical algorithms and powerful neural network algorithms. Especially, the soft device assisted by neural network will be introduced carefully.

Identifying novel subtypes in cancer can help classify patients with similar molecular and clinical phenotypes. This work proposes an end-to-end pipeline for subgroup identification in NSCLC. Here, we used a machine learning (ML) based approach to compress the multi-omics NSCLC data to a lower dimensional space. This data is subjected to consensus K-means clustering to identify the five novel clusters (C1–C5). Survival analysis of the resulting clusters revealed a significant difference in the overall survival of clusters (p-value: 0.019). Each cluster was then molecularly characterized to identify specific molecular characteristics. We found that cluster C3 showed minimal genetic aberration with a high prognosis. Next, classification models were developed using data from each omic level to predict the subgroup of unseen patients. Decision‑level fused classification models were then built using these classifiers, which were used to classify unseen patients into five novel clusters. We also showed that the multi-omics-based classification model outperformed single-omic-based models, and the combination of classifiers proved to be a more accurate prediction model than the individual classifiers. In summary, we have used ML models to develop a classification method and identified five novel NSCLC clusters with different genetic and clinical characteristics.",,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Yet, in current cryogen-based MEG systems the sensors are offset from the scalp, which limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thereby the sensitivity to activity from deep structures such as the hippocampus. This effect is amplified in children, for whom adult-sized fixed-helmet systems are typically too big. Moreover, ictal recordings with fixed-helmet systems are problematic because of limited movement tolerance and/or logistical considerations. Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPMs) can be placed directly on the scalp, thereby improving SNR and enabling recordings during seizures. We aimed to demonstrate the performance of OPMs in a clinical population. Seven patients with challenging cases of epilepsy underwent MEG recordings using a 12-channel OPM-system and a 306-channel cryogen-based whole-head system: three adults with known deep or weak (low SNR) sources of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), along with three children with focal epilepsy and one adult with frequent seizures. The consistency of the recorded IEDs across the two systems was assessed. In one patient the OPMs detected IEDs that were not found with the SQUID-system, and in two patients no IEDs were found with either system. For the other patients the OPM data were remarkably consistent with the data from the cryogenic system, noting that these were recorded in different sessions, with comparable SNRs and IED-yields overall. Importantly, the wearability of OPMs enabled the recording of seizure activity in a patient with hyperkinetic movements during the seizure. The observed ictal onset and semiology were in agreement with previous video- and stereo-EEG recordings. The relatively affordable technology, in combination with reduced running and maintenance costs, means that OPM-based MEG could be used more widely than current MEG systems, and may become an affordable alternative to scalp EEG, with the potential benefits of increased spatial accuracy, reduced sensitivity to volume conduction/field spread, and increased sensitivity to deep sources. Wearable MEG thus provides an unprecedented opportunity for epilepsy, and given its patient-friendliness, we envisage that it will not only be used for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients, but also for diagnosis after a first seizure.",,1,1,repositoryvor,Green,WT,EC19-05,Wellcome Trust

This study aimed to assess the automatic detectability of PWMLs in infants on deep learning using composite images created from several cases. To create the initial composite images, magnetic resonance (MR) images of two infants with the most PWMLs were used; their PWMLs were extracted and pasted onto MR images of infants without abnormality, creating many composite PWML images. Deep learning models based on a convolutional neural network, You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3), were constructed using the training set of 600, 1200, 2400, and 3600 composite images. As a result, a threshold of detection probability of 20% and 30% for all deep learning model sets yielded a relatively high sensitivity for automatic PWML detection (0.908–0.957). Although relatively high false-positive detections occurred with the lower threshold of detection probability, primarily, in the partial volume of the cerebral cortex (≥ 85.8%), those can be easily distinguished from the white matter lesions. Relatively highly sensitive automatic detection of PWMLs was achieved by creating composite images from two cases using deep learning.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology and chemistry, and has puzzled scientists for 50 years. The advent of AF2 presents an unprecedented progress in protein structure prediction and has attracted much attention. Subsequent release of structures of more than 200 million proteins predicted by AF2 further aroused great enthusiasm in the science community, especially in the fields of biology and medicine. AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine. Limitations of current AF2 prediction will also be discussed.",,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,L222007,National Natural Science Foundation of China

However, autonomous exploration of advanced materials with complex, multi-step processes and data sparse environments remains a challenge. In this work, we present AlphaFlow, a self-driven fluidic lab capable of autonomous discovery of complex multi-step chemistries. AlphaFlow uses reinforcement learning integrated with a modular microdroplet reactor capable of performing reaction steps with variable sequence, phase separation, washing, and continuous in-situ spectral monitoring. To demonstrate the power of reinforcement learning toward high dimensionality multi-step chemistries, we use AlphaFlow to discover and optimize synthetic routes for shell-growth of core-shell semiconductor nanoparticles, inspired by colloidal atomic layer deposition (cALD). Without prior knowledge of conventional cALD parameters, AlphaFlow successfully identified and optimized a novel multi-step reaction route, with up to 40 parameters, that outperformed conventional sequences. Through this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of closed-loop, reinforcement learning-guided systems in exploring and solving challenges in multi-step nanoparticle syntheses, while relying solely on in-house generated data from a miniaturized microfluidic platform. Further application of AlphaFlow in multi-step chemistries beyond cALD can lead to accelerated fundamental knowledge generation as well as synthetic route discoveries and optimization.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSF,ML-21-064,National Science Foundation
